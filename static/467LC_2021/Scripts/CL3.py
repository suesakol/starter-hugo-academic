# Week 3: Python Basics



# Code 1.1

Explicit is better than implicit. 
Simple is better than complex. 
Complex is better than complicated. 
Flat is better than nested.'''

print(l)

# Code 1.2
# type() function

# Will this work?

# Code 1.4

# Code 1.6

Name_Inst = 'sakol'



# Code 1.8
# variable names canâ€™t be reserved words. check:
help("keywords")



# Code 1.9
pounds = 150
lbs    = pounds
pounds = 175

pounds # or print(pounds)
lbs    # which value?



# Code 1.10

# Create string variables

And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could

# Code 1.12
# \n for newlines
print("cars, \nMars, \nand some vars")

# \t for tabs

# \" to have double quotes inside double quotes

# Code 1.13
# Let's start with the basics
x = 10
x + 3
x ** 3

# How about strings
rs = "npr"
tv = "pbs"
rs + tv
rs + " " + tv
rs * 3
rs / 3  # What's going to happen here?



# Code 1.14
# print() a function with arguments inside parentheses
print(rs, tv)

# This is similar to rs + tv

# Combine string variables with texts

# This is the same poem in Code 1.11
# .split() returns a list

# Code 1.18
fairy = "Once upon a time, in a far, far away land. There's a charming princess."

# Case
fairy.lower()
fairy.upper()
fairy.capitalize()

# Replacing: ('old', 'new')

# String multiple methods together
fairy.lower().replace('time', 'century')

# But watch out replace() needs an exact match
fairy.upper()
fairy.upper().replace('time', 'century')
fairy.upper().replace('A', 'AN')

# This isn't efficient but does the job
fairy.replace('.', '!').replace(',', ';')

# Frequency counts (exact match)
fairy.count('far')
fairy.count('Far') # Different from the above

# Remove leading & trailing spaces
ad = "     Privacy, simplified    "
