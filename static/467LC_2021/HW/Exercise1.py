# Instructions: Read each line of comments carefully. Complete the code as instructed.
# This exercise is worth 10 points (plus two extra points).

# You are not allowed to collaborate on this assignment.




# 1. Calculate seconds per hour: Multiply the number of seconds in a minute by the number of minutes in another.
#    Assign the calculation to a variable called seconds_per_hour and print out the value of that variable.
# [1 point]





# 2. Calculate seconds per day. Use your seconds_per_hour variable from 1. 
#    Save the calculation in a variable called seconds_per_day and print out the value of that variable.
# [ 1 point]





# 3. Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour. Use floating-point division. Print out the value.
# [0.5 points]





# 4. Count how many times 'sh' occurs in a string 'she sells seashells by the seashore' and print out the result.
# [0.5 points]





# 5. Replace certain characters in a string 'Hello, world!' so that you get 'Herro, worrg!' in your output.
#    Supply the code. There's no need to print out the result.
# [1 point]





# 6. Split a string 'The world is a truly magnificant place.' and print out the list.
# [0.5 points]





# 7. Lowercase a string 'Disinformation for Hire, a Shadow Industry Is Quietly Booming'. 
#    Then, remove spaces and punctuation. Print out the result.
# [1 point]





# 8. Obtain the length of a string 'A South Korean broadcaster apologized for inappropriate images during the Olympic parade' 
#    after spaces are removed. Report the length by printing it out.
# [1 point]





# 9. You have the following string 'Come in. We're open!'. Wrap your codes inside print() to return:
#    9.1 COME IN. WE'RE OPEN!
#    9.2 come in. we're open!
# [0.5 points]





# 10. Extract the word 'iPhone' from a string 'This is an iPhone'. Provide two options to get this substring.
# [0.5 points]





# 11. Remove whitespace characters from a string '         End of the walkway.........   ' and print out the result
# [0.5 points]





# 12. Write a program that calculate a users' body mass index (BMI). The program must do the following in order:
#     12.1 Asks the user to enter his/her weight in kilograms.
#     12.2 Asks the user to enter his/her height in meters (e.g., 1.58, 1.63, 1.72).
#     12.3 Calculate BMI: divide the weight by height squared (that is, height ** 2)
#     12.4 Print out the BMI value

# Hint: Do not forget to convert users' input (weight and height) into an integer and a floating point before you divide the two values

#     Extra (2 points): 
#     12.5 Print out a message that interprets the BMI value 
#          - BMI > 25.0 means a person is overweight
#          - BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 means a person is healthy.
#     To accomplish this step, you'll need to (1) use an if-else structure and (2) do some equality test

# [2 points + (extra 2 points)]
