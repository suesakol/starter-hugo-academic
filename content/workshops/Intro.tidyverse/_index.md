This three-day virtual workshop focuses on most commonly used elements in the `Tidyverse` package for exploratory data analysis. The workshop is designed for those who have no background in programming but would like to take advantage of R for data wrangling. Attendees are led through a series of hands-on activities that cover R and `Tidyverse` basics. The workshop is designed to help attendees gain a foothold in R and make use of existing functions from the `readr` and `dplyr` packages. The workshop is conducted in Thai. It is offered virtually via Zoom on March 18 and 25 and April 1, 2022.
