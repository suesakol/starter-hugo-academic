My current projects focus on a connection between distributional information to which sequential bilinguals/second language (L2) users are exposed and their variable L2 knowledge. A sample of current projects are as follows:

#### English permissive constructions
**Collaborator**: Sarut Supasiraprapa               <br>
**Stage**:           Data collection                          <br>
**Experiment**:    `https://6acveoz6nr.cognition.run`

**Aim**:     To test whether L2 users' choice of constructions is aligned with a corpus model.        <br>
**Context**: The project combines corpus and experimental methods to investigate two permissive constructions in English (let + V and permit + to V). We retrieved instances of the two constructions from the British National Corpus and fitted a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression model to the data to reveal factors that predicted the probability of usage of the constructions. Armed with this information, we are conducting an online experiment with native and non-native speakers of English. Participants are presented with several short passages and instructed to choose between the two alternative constructions to complete a blank in each passage.
