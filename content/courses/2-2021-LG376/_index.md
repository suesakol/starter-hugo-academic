## Course Description
ทฤษฎีและแนวคิดในการรับภาษาที่สอง กระบวนการรับภาษาที่สอง ปัจจัยต่างๆ ที่มีอิทธิพลต่อผลสัมฤทธิ์ของผู้เรียนที่แตกต่างกัน

Multilingualism, the knowledge and use of more than one language by individuals and groups, is as old as humanity itself. Second language acquisition (SLA) is the scholarly field that investigates the human capacity to learn languages other than the first in late childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. In this course, we will examine various sources of influences on the learning of additional languages later in life. These include age, crosslinguistic influence, the linguistic environment, cognition, the development of learner language, and motivation and affect. As a prerequisite, successful completion of LG 211 Introduction to Linguistics (with C or above) is required.

&nbsp;



## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, you should be able to do the following:
1. identify major themes, questions, issues, and hypotheses in SLA;
2. summarize, synthesize, and evaluate reports of SLA research;
3. replicate an existing study in SLA and report on the project's findings; and
4. improve and refine their scholarly writing and presentation skills.

&nbsp;



## Classroom-based Expectations
1. **Attend class and participate in class discussions** 
  * Attendance is required at **all** classes.
  * Participation is crucial to the educational effectiveness of the course.
  * You are responsible for the materials covered and homework assigned during any absence.

2. **Complete all readings and assignments on time.** 
  * You are expected to compete the readings **before** each class meeting so that you will be prepared to participate in group work and discussions. 
  * You are also expected to submit each assignment or homework punctually.
  * Only in medical or personal emergencies will late work be accepted. Communicate with me early if you anticipate having trouble completing any assignment in a timely manner.

3. **Plagiarism is not tolerated.** 
  * Plagiarizing other people's work in an assignment results in an automatic zero for that assignment.

4. **Follow APA guidelines for all written assignments.** 
  * The following resources provide helpful information on APA style:
  * American Psychological Association. (2020). *Publication manual of the American Psychological Association* (7th edition). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.
