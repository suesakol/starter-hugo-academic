## Course Description
ทฤษฎีและแนวคิดในการรับภาษาที่สอง กระบวนการรับภาษาที่สอง ปัจจัยต่างๆ ที่มีอิทธิพลต่อผลสัมฤทธิ์ของผู้เรียนที่แตกต่างกัน

Multilingualism, the knowledge and use of more than one language by individuals and groups, is as old as humanity itself. Second language acquisition (SLA) is the scholarly field that investigates the human capacity to learn languages other than the first in late childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. In this course, we will examine various sources of influences on the learning of additional languages later in life. These include age, crosslinguistic influence, the linguistic environment, cognition, the development of learner language, and motivation and affect.

&nbsp;



## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, you should be able to do the following:
1. identify major themes, questions, issues, and hypotheses in SLA;
2. summarize, synthesize, and evaluate reports of SLA research;
3. replicate an existing study in SLA and report on the project's findings; and
4. improve and refine their scholarly writing and presentation skills.

&nbsp;


## Classroom-based Expectations
1. **Attend class and participate in class discussions** 
- Attendance is required at **all** classes.
- Participation is crucial to the educational effectiveness of the course.

2. **Timely submission of assignments is expected.** All work must be submitted before the due date as stated on the syllabus. I have the right to refuse acceptance of any late assignment. Please communicate with me early if you anticipate having trouble completing any assignment in a timely manner.

3. **Plagiarism is not tolerated.** Plagiarizing other people's work in an assignment results in an automatic zero for that assignment.

4. **Completion of weekly readings before class is critical.** You are expected to complete readings before class and come to class prepared to ask questions and/or participate in class discussion.

&nbsp;



## Prerequisites
Successful completion of LG 211 Introduction to Linguistics (with C or above) is required. You do not need to have any programming experience to complete this course. You are expected, however, to bring your own laptop to class and ensure that it runs either Windows 10 or Mac OS 10.15 (Catalina) or above. Tablets or smartphones are generally not recommended. Talk to me if you need help with the university's laptop assistance program. :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

2. Jurafsky, D., & Martin, J. H. (2020). *Speech and language processing* ([3rd ed. online draft](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)). [J & M for short]
3. Bird, S. et al. *Natural language processing with Python* ([online edition for Python 3](https://www.nltk.org/book/)). [NLTK for short]

&nbsp;



## Course organization
In most cases, each class meeting will have lecture and practice components. During the first half of each class, we will cover topics presented in textbooks (L & C or J & M). As for the other half, you will receive hands-on training with Python and [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](http://www.nltk.org).

Course management is done through **this course website** and **MS Teams**. You can obtain course materials (syllabus, slides, assignments, etc.) from this website. Assignment submissions, class announcements, and grades will be handled through MS Teams.

## Assignments and Grading

### Grading scale:
In this course, I assign grades based on how well students perform. The grading scheme outlines key letter grades:

|   |Grades       |   |  Points              |  |  |Grades       |  |  Points              | 
|---|:------------|---|:---------------------|--|--|:------------|--|:---------------------|
|   | A           |   |  85-100%             |  |  | C           |  |  65-69.99            |
|   | B+          |   |  80-84.99            |  |  | D+          |  |  60-64.99            |
|   | B           |   |  75-79.99            |  |  | D           |  |  55-59.99            |
|   | C+          |   |  70-74.99            |  |  | F           |  |  0-54.99             |


### Grade breakdown:

|  Requirements              | Percent      | Points                       | Note    |
|:---------------------------|:------------:|:-----------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| Homework assignments       | 50%          | 10 points each, 6 in total   |                                            |
| Programming exercises      | 40%          | 10 points each, 5-6 planned  | Exercise with lowest mark dropped[^1]      |
| Participation              | 5%           |                              |                                            |
| Attendance                 | 5%           |                              | Up to one unexcused absence allowed        |


### Overview:

- Homework (i.e., assignments and exercises) is assigned on an approximately weekly basis. Typically, it will be **distributed on Wednesday after class** and due **Saturday night of the same week**. Extensions **may** be granted only in special circumstances (e.g., family or medical emergencies). Please communicate these to me in advance whenever possible.

- Both assignments and exercises will be weighted equally in their respective categories. The assignment with the lowest mark will be dropped.

- To receive full credit for attendance and participation, you are expected to come to class on time and engage meaningfully with the class content, including participating in class discussion. 

- You are allowed no more than one unexcused absence without affecting your course grade. This does not include excused absences due to illness or religious observances.
