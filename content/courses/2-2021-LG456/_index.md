## Course Description
ความสัมพันธ์ระหว่างภาษาศาสตร์และศาสตร์อื่นๆ ที่เกี่ยวข้อง อาทิ จิตวิทยาการสื่อสาร การเรียนและการสอนภาษา ความบกพร่องด้านภาษา และการแปล

This course introduces students to the field of applied linguistics. It serves as an overview of the diverse areas in which applied linguists are engaged. The course is divided into three parts, each of which represents a major theme of research in applied linguistics. In the first part, **language in development**, we will survey issues related to second and additional language (L2/Ln) learning in adulthood, bi/multilingualism, and language attrition. Next, we will explore **language in use**, focusing on how applied linguists study language in interaction. In so doing, we will explore topics such as intercultural communication and study abroad. In the third and final section, we will examine **language in society**, with a particular emphasis on issues related to identity, race, and gender, as investigated by applied linguists. We will also consider language policy and language planning. Students will be given an opportunity to make connections between their own research interests and a particular area of applied linguistics through a research-based project.

&nbsp;



## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, you should be able to do the following:
1. read, critique, and evaluate past and current research on the topic of your interest(s) and on major issues in applied linguistics;
2. present ideas and viewpoints, both orally and in writing, that show engagement with and connection to the literature of applied linguistics;
3. demonstrate expertise with a chosen research method by collecting and analyzing data; and
4. design, conduct, and write a collaborative research study on a topic of your choice.

&nbsp;



## Classroom-based Expectations
1. **Attend class and participate in class discussions** 
  * Attendance is required at **all** classes.
  * Participation is crucial to the educational effectiveness of the course.

## Assignments and Grading

### Grading scale:
In this course, I assign grades based on how well students perform. The grading scheme outlines key letter grades:

|   |Grades       |   |  Points              |  |  |Grades       |  |  Points              | 
|---|:------------|---|:---------------------|--|--|:------------|--|:---------------------|
|   | A           |   |  85-100%             |  |  | C           |  |  65-69.99            |
|   | B+          |   |  80-84.99            |  |  | D+          |  |  60-64.99            |
|   | B           |   |  75-79.99            |  |  | D           |  |  55-59.99            |
|   | C+          |   |  70-74.99            |  |  | F           |  |  0-54.99             |

### Assignment descriptions:

1. **Participation and attendance (10%)**
  * The participation grade is determined by my impression of a student's (a) productive and consistent contribution to class discussions and activities (e.g., commenting, questioning, relation to own experience), (b) conscientious collaboration with classmates on work inside and outside of class (e.g., shouldering one's fair share of work during group projects, contributing to and being on task during group discussions), and (c) attendance and punctuality.
  * There is no such thing as an excused absence in this course, expect in instances where documentation from a health professional or university administrator is provided explaning the absence.

2. **Two study synopses (20%)**
  * You will be asked to summarize two empirical studies of SLA/Bilingualism that we read throughout the semester, each in a one-page synopsis format. The goals of this assignment are: (a) to help you read with an eye for the underlying structure of the research reports, (b) to help you deepen your understanding of the readings, and (c) hopefully, to foster this kind of synthetic note-taking strategy in other readings that you do for the final project and other readings in class.
  
3. **In-class quizzes (20%)**
  * You will complete **three (3) open-book quizzes**, interspersed throughout the semester. Each quiz is designed to assess your understanding of reading materials assigned for that particular week and will take place at the beginning of the class, from 9:30 to 9:45 am. Check the schedule for each quiz. Note that no makeup quiz will be given.

4. **'Test your vocabulary' (5%)**
  * This is a short assignment to bring to class on Week 9, when we read about vocabulary and memory. You will take a vocabulary test and come to class with your results and be prepared to discuss them.

5. **PsychoPy experiment (15%)**
  * This assignment is collaborative and should be carried out in groups of three (3) people. You will create a lexical decision task experiment in [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org). This experiment script should contain (a) task instructions, (b) practice session, (c) main task component, and (d) debriefing. You will use this experiment to collect data from your participants and the information you obtain will be reported in your group's final collaborative project. In the second half of the course, we will learn how to build a lexical decision task using PsychoPy Builder.

6. **Final collaborative project (35%)**
  * The final project builds on the PsychoPy experiment assignment; thus, it is necessary that you work with the same group of people. The project will give you the opportunity to develop your academic research and writing skill as you replicate an existing study in SLA. The final project is divided into three smaller parts:
  
    * **Project references (5%)**
      - For this one-page assignment, you will develop a list of references based in part on Supasiraprapa's (2019) study. Your reference list must include two or more articles published since 2019 and contain both theoretical papers in SLA as well as empirical studies. The reference list should conform to APA format and stay within a one-page limit. This assignment will provide the basis of the literature review for your final paper.
  
    * **Draft submission of your final project (15%)**
      - By April 21, your group should submit a working draft of the final collaborative project that contains the following:
        - A provisional title of your project
        - A literature review outlining key issues in your replication study
        - Overarching research question(s)
        - An outline of the method and results section
    
    * **Written final submission (15%)**
      - Excluding references, the final paper should be approximately 6 solid pages. It must be typed in 12-point font and double-spaced with 1-inch margins. All in-text citations and references must follow APA format. The paper should read as a single coherent piece of writing, with tile, an introductory overview, a presentation of method and results, an overall conclusion, and a reference list. Criteria for assessment will be provided later in the course.
