## Course Description
ความสัมพันธ์ระหว่างภาษาศาสตร์และศาสตร์อื่นๆ ที่เกี่ยวข้อง อาทิ จิตวิทยาการสื่อสาร การเรียนและการสอนภาษา ความบกพร่องด้านภาษา และการแปล

This course introduces students to the field of applied linguistics. It serves as an overview of the diverse areas in which applied linguists are engaged. The course is divided into four parts, each of which represents a major theme of research in applied linguistics. In the first part, **language in development**, we will survey issues related to bi/multilingualism and language attrition. Next, we will explore **language in use**, focusing on how applied linguists study language in interaction. In so doing, we will explore topics such as intercultural communication and study abroad. In the third section, we will examine **language in society**, with a particular emphasis on issues related to identity, race, and gender, as investigated by applied linguists. We will also consider language policy and language planning. In the fourth and final section, **language in public life**, we will explore translation and interpreting. Students will be given an opportunity to make connections between their own research interests and a particular area of applied linguistics through a research-based project.

&nbsp;



## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, you should be able to do the following:
1. read, critique, and evaluate past and current research on the topic of your interest(s) and on major issues in applied linguistics;
2. present ideas and viewpoints, both orally and in writing, that show engagement with and connection to the literature of applied linguistics;
3. demonstrate expertise with a chosen research method by collecting and analyzing data; and
4. design, conduct, and write a collaborative research study on a topic of your choice.

&nbsp;



## Classroom-based Expectations
1. **Attend class and participate in class discussions** 
  * Attendance is required at **all** classes.
  * Participation is crucial to the educational effectiveness of the course and relates to active engagement in all aspects of the class.
  * You are responsible for the materials covered and homework assigned during any absence.

2. **Complete all readings and assignments on time.** 
  * You are expected to compete the readings **before** each class meeting so that you will be prepared to participate in group work and discussions. 
  * You are also expected to submit each assignment or homework punctually.
  * Only in medical or personal emergencies will late work be accepted. Communicate with me early if you anticipate having trouble completing any assignment in a timely manner.

3. **Plagiarism is not tolerated.**

## Assignments and Grading

### Grading scale:
In this course, I assign grades based on how well students perform. The grading scheme outlines key letter grades:

  * **A   85-100%**
    + Grade at the A-level indicates an accurate, nuanced understanding of the concepts and issues covered in the class lectures and readings. It also displays the ability to apply those concepts accurately and coherently in the assignments. A-level work also includes evidence of synthesis of information and insight that goes beyond summarization of the materials.
  
  * **B+ 80-84.99**
  * **B   75-79.99** 
    + Grades at the B-level indicate accurate understanding of the concepts and issues covered in the class lectures and readings, although there may be some minor errors, omissions, or misunderstandings. They indicate some ability to apply concepts accurately and coherently in the assignments, but answers may not be comprehensive or well-organized. B-level work represents the ability to summarize the arguments and issues presented through course materials, but may lack independent analysis or synthesis.
  
  * **C+ 70-74.99**
  * **C   65-69.99**
    + Grades at the C-level indicate a fairly accurate and/or incomplete understanding of the concepts and issues covered in class lectures and readings, with some major and minor errors or omissions concerning basic information. They indicate little ability to apply concepts accurately and coherently in the assignments, and generally lack organization and depth.
  
  * **D+ 60-64.99**
  * **D   55-59.99**
    + Grades at the D-level indicate an inaccurate and/or incomplete understanding of the concepts and issues covered in class lectures and readings, with multiple errors and omissions concerning basic information. They suggest a lack of ability to apply concepts accurately or coherently in the assignments.
    
  * **F    0-54.99**
    + Grade at the F-level indicates failure to understand the concepts and issues covered in class lectures and readings, with little indication that basic information has been grasped.

### Assignment descriptions:

1. **Research interests (5%)**
  * For this assignment, you will discuss which area(s) or aspect(s) of language and linguistics you are interested in and how these interests can address real-world problems. You may choose to do the following:
    + First, identify areas of linguistics that fascinate you (e.g., morphology, phonology, syntax, pragmatics, etc.) or language-related topics that pique your interests (e.g., mansplaining in everyday conversation, productivity of English past tense morpheme -*ed*, children learning quantifiers such as *some* and *many*, etc.)
    + Then, think about issue(s) and/or problem(s) you observe with regard to these topics. For instance, you may notice that people with more authority tend to mansplain regardless of their gender. From a different angle, you may be intrigued by how *man*- words are formed (e.g., *mansplain*, *manspread*, *man purse*, etc.) and would like to find out if English language learners can grasp the meaning of these words.
    + As you go through these steps, use Google Scholar to find out if your research topics have been investigated by other researchers. In all likelihood, you will not be the first person to come up with these research ideas. Read what has already been done and then refine and/or sharpen your ideas.
    
  * This assignment is designed to help you relate your knowledge of linguistics and language to real-world issues (i.e., how language is learned and used in society). This real-world emphasis is what sets applied linguistics apart from other fields of linguistics. List each of your research topic and/or idea in a bullet point and under each point, provide a short description of issues surrounding that particular topic. <span style="color: red;">Keep this assignment within a single page</span>.


2. **Two study synopses (20%)**
  * You will summarize 2 empirical studies in applied linguistics that we read throughout the semester, each in **a one-page synopsis format**. The goals of this assignment are: (a) to help you read with an eye for the underlying structure of research reports, (b) to encourage a two-way reading mode, from attention to detail back to a bird's-eye view perspective, (c) to help you deepen your understanding of these readings, and (d) hopefully, to foster this kind of synthetic note-taking strategy in other readings you do for your final project and the rest of readings in class.
  * A study synopsis is almost like an x-ray of a study. It should take up a single, one-sided page. A study synopsis should contain the following sections:
    + theoretical framework
    + research question(s)/purpose
    + method
    + findings
    + the "so what" of the article (e.g., why the study matters, as stated by the authors)
    + your own "so what" after you are done analyzing, evaluating, and summarizing the article
  
3. **Discussion leading (15%)**
  * In groups of five, you will be responsible for leading a class discussion on a chosen topic. This involves: (a) preparing and delivering a presentation that summarizes key points of class readings and; (b) leading a class through some hands-on, data-driven activity. For this assignment, you may choose to do the following:
    + Prepare a presentation summarizing main points presented by the author(s) (10 slides max).
    + Prepare 3 to 6 discussion questions to use during your presentation.
    + Select one empirical study cited in a book chapter/article you facilitate.
    + Use data/transcripts/activities/excerpts from that study to prepare one activity that highlights or illustrates key observations made in the class readings.
  
  * Your class discussion should cover about 1/3 of class time (1 hour). **The class is not expected to read a study you select in Step 3**, so your hands-on, data-driven activities should be able to stand on their own.
  
  * After you sign up on Week 4 (Feb 1), you will be asked to meet with me to discuss your plan for class discussion. One week before your scheduled class, please submit all of the materials you plan to use in class, so I can provide detailed feedback on them.

4. **Final research based project (50%)**
  * The research-based project will give you the opportunity to develop your academic research, writing, and presentation skills as you work through the various phases of an inquiry-based project, from the initial idea-generating phase to the final written report and presentation of findings. **Your project can be on any topic in applied linguistics**.

  * The project is collaborative, that is, it should be carried out in groups of 4-5 people. A fair amount of time and effort will be demanded by the process of formulating a question; deciding what information you require in order to answer it; obtaining and interpreting that information; integrating it with your group members' work; and then drawing conclusions based on all of this. So you are encouraged to start early. To help you complete this assignment in a timely manner, we will divide up the project into four installments.
  
  * **Installment I: Provisional plan (10%)**
    + In Installment I, you are expected to submit a rough sketch of your research project. This should include:
  
    * **Draft submission of your final project (15%)**
      - By April 21, your group should submit a working draft of the final collaborative project that contains the following:
        - A provisional title of your project
        - A literature review outlining key issues in your replication study
        - Overarching research question(s)
        - An outline of the method and results section
    
    * **Written final submission (15%)**
      - Excluding references, the final paper should be approximately 6 solid pages. It must be typed in 12-point font and double-spaced with 1-inch margins. All in-text citations and references must follow APA format. The paper should read as a single coherent piece of writing, with tile, an introductory overview, a presentation of method and results, an overall conclusion, and a reference list. Criteria for assessment will be provided later in the course.
