I am a lecturer of linguistics in the Department of English and Linguistics at Thammasat University, Thailand. My research investigates issues related to probabilistic statistical information that bi/multilingual speakers recruit in second (L2) or additional language (Ln) processing and learning. Using experimental and corpus-based methods, my research seeks to understand how statistical information of language guides online processing and shapes long-term representation of linguistic constructions in bi/multilinguals. I teach courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels.
